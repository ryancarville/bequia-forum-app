				Started in 2019, Bequia Forum is a place for locals and travelers alike
				to get the most of the island of the clouds. For years Bequia has only
				had platforms like Facebook and Trip Advisor to showcase all it has to
				offer and we thought it deserved better. Its own platform to connect to
				the world. Bequia Forum is a non-profit orginazation that only has one
				mission. To allow users to get all the information they need in one
				place.{' '}
